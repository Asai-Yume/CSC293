# Instructions for using the course Voron Trident

The Voron Trident is the 3D printer for this course. It is optimized
for printing ABS. It can print PLA, but it will require special setup
to maintain cooling.

The printer runs Klipper and is accessed through a web interface,
called Mainsail.

## Connectivity

First, configure a Wireguard tunnel to this machine, following these
[Wireguard instructions](wireguard.md).

You need to do this only once.

## Slicer Setup

This printer has been tested with Cura. Other slicers will probably
work.

   - [Cura Settings](cura-settings.md)
   - [Generic Settings](generic-settings.md) (for other slicers)

Please contribute settings and instructions for other slicers through a pull request.
