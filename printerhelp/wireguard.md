# Wireguard setup for accessing the printer

I've set up a IPv6 Wireguard tunnel to access the printer. You'll need to
[install Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/install/) on your machine.

## Generate an IPv6 address

Use the [ulagen.py](../scripts/ulagen.py) script to generate an IPv6
address for your device:

```
python3 ./ulagen.py fd29:2be2:cb1e::/64
```

## Configure Wireguard

```
[Interface]

# pre-populated by the WireGuard UI
PrivateKey = ...

# the IP address of this client on the WireGuard network
Address = [IPv6 address generated by ulagen.py]

[Peer]
PublicKey=ilvnJHUy/edrGhjN5nVCyJ7bTAaaMAdC/SBrf8p06x0=
Endpoint=wg.thirdlaw.net:55820
AllowedIPs=fd29:2be2:cb1e::/64
```

## Send Your Information

Send the following information:

  - IPv6 address
  - PUBLIC key

to me (Prof. Pai).
